### Project: **GopherGuard** — Your AI-Powered Self-Healing GitOps Guardian (built entirely in Go)

**One-sentence pitch**:  
A lightweight Kubernetes Operator written in Go that watches your GitOps-managed apps (ArgoCD Applications or Flux Kustomizations), detects issues with real observability, asks an LLM for a smart diagnosis + fix, then automatically opens a Pull Request with the exact YAML patch so ArgoCD/Flux deploys the fix — all while giving you hilarious/witty LLM-powered status updates.

**Why this project is *ideal* for you right now**:
- **Go mastery**: Full reconciliation loops, CRDs, controllers — the exact skills companies want for cloud-native/Platform Engineering roles.
- **Kubernetes deep dive**: Watching resources, fetching logs/metrics, events, custom resources.
- **AIOps in action**: Real LLM reasoning (not just alerts) for root-cause analysis and remediation suggestions — exactly the 2026 trend (see Flux MCP Server, Argo AI assistants, Prophet project, K8sGPT).
- **GitOps + Continuous Delivery**: Everything is declarative. The operator itself is deployed/managed by ArgoCD or Flux. Fixes happen via PR → auto-sync. You’ll live the full GitOps loop.
- **Fun factor**: 
  - LLM gives personality (e.g., “This pod crashed harder than my hopes for Monday. Here’s the fix, boss.”).
  - Simple HTMX dashboard showing “Healing Score” and timeline of AI interventions.
  - Chaos demo: Deploy a deliberately buggy “JokeService” that randomly 500s or OOMs — watch GopherGuard detect, diagnose, PR the fix, and ArgoCD/Flux apply it in <2 minutes. Record a 60-second demo video — instant portfolio gold.
- **Future-proof payoff**: Mirrors real open-source projects like **Prophet** (AIOps-powered Go operators with self-healing + ArgoCD) and production patterns at companies doing agentic ops in 2026. You’ll be able to say “I built an AI-augmented self-healing platform in Go” in interviews.

**Scope**: Doable in 4–6 weeks part-time. Start tiny, add power-ups. Production-ready skeleton by week 3.

### Tech Stack (All 2026-current & resume-friendly)
- **Go 1.23+** + `controller-runtime` + Kubebuilder (official way to build operators)
- **LLM integration**: Anthropic Claude via the Messages API (tiny `net/http` wrapper)
- **GitOps**: ArgoCD (easier UI) *or* Flux v2 — your choice. Operator creates PRs using `github.com/google/go-github`
- **Observability**: Prometheus client-go + Kubernetes events/logs
- **UI (optional but fun)**: Echo/Fiber + HTMX for zero-JS dashboard
- **Local cluster**: kind + Tilt (hot reload for operators)
- **Chaos**: chaos-mesh or just a simple buggy Go app you write
- **Deployment**: The entire GopherGuard (CRDs + Deployment) lives in a Git repo managed by ArgoCD/Flux

### High-Level Architecture
```
Your Git Repo (GitOps source of truth)
   ↓ (ArgoCD/Flux syncs)
GopherGuard Operator (running in cluster)
   ├── Watches: Deployments, Pods, ArgoCD Applications / Flux Kustomizations
   ├── On anomaly → fetch logs/metrics
   ├── Prompt LLM: "Diagnose + give me a safe YAML patch"
   ├── Create GitHub PR with patch
   └── ArgoCD/Flux merges & syncs → fixed!
   └── Bonus: Slack/Discord webhook with funny LLM summary
```

### Phased Build Plan (Make it addictive — celebrate each milestone)

**Week 1: Foundation & Fun Setup (get the dopamine)**
1. `kind create cluster`
2. Bootstrap ArgoCD *or* Flux entirely from a new Git repo (official quickstart — 10 mins).
3. Deploy a sample “JokeService” app (simple Go HTTP server that randomly crashes) via ArgoCD/Flux.
4. `kubebuilder init --domain gopherguard.dev --repo github.com/yourname/gopherguard`
5. Create `AegisWatch` CRD (e.g., `kubectl apply -f` on your JokeService).
6. Basic reconciler that just logs “I see you!” when the CR appears.
   *Milestone*: Watch your operator react in real-time with `make run`.

**Week 2: Kubernetes + Observability Muscles**
- Watch Pods/Deployments for crashes, high CPU, OOMs.
- Fetch logs + events using controller-runtime client.
- Add Prometheus query for metrics.
   *Milestone*: Operator prints “Houston, we have a crashing pod” with details.

**Week 3: AIOps Magic (the wow moment)**
- Call LLM with a smart prompt (include logs, metrics, YAML of the resource).
- Parse response → extract suggested YAML patch.
- *Fun*: Make the LLM output in JSON + a witty one-liner.
   *Milestone*: Operator comments on GitHub issue or prints “AI says: add memory limit 256Mi — applying...”

**Week 4: Full GitOps Loop + Personality**
- Use go-github to open PR against your app’s repo with the patch file.
- Add Slack webhook with LLM-generated message + emoji.
- Deploy GopherGuard *itself* via ArgoCD/Flux (meta!).
   *Milestone*: Trigger chaos → PR appears automatically → merge → fixed. Record it.

**Week 5–6: Polish & Extensions (portfolio rocket fuel)**
- HTMX dashboard showing healing history.
- Support *both* ArgoCD and Flux (watch different CRs).
- Add “safe mode” (only suggest, never auto-PR).
- Multi-cluster (via ArgoCD ApplicationSets).
- Bonus: Add safe-mode-only dry-run reporting dashboard.

### Resources to Get You Unstuck Fast
- **Operator core**: Kubebuilder book (free, updated 2025) + controller-runtime examples on GitHub.
- **LLM in Go**: Anthropic Messages API docs + `net/http` — straightforward REST calls.
- **Git PRs**: Official go-github examples.
- **Inspiration**: Clone https://github.com/holynakamoto/prophet (real AIOps Go operators with ArgoCD self-healing — study the `operators/` folder).
- **Chaos demo**: chaos-mesh quickstart or just `kubectl exec` to kill pods.
- **Deploy with GitOps**: ArgoCD “getting started” or Flux “bootstrap” docs.

You’ll finish with:
- A working, fun tool you can run on any cluster.
- Deep understanding of 2026’s hottest stack (Go operators + LLM agents + GitOps self-healing).
- A killer GitHub repo + demo video for interviews.

Start **today** with Week 1 — it’ll take you <2 hours to have the skeleton running and already feel the “I’m building real platform stuff” rush.

Want me to give you the exact `kubebuilder` commands + first reconciler code snippet, or a ready-made GitHub repo template to fork? Or decide between ArgoCD vs Flux for you? Just say the word and we’ll kick it off.  

You’re going to crush this — and in 6 weeks you’ll be the person who *builds* the AI-augmented platforms everyone else is just talking about. Let’s go! 🚀
